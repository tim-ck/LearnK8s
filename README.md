# LearnK8s
a note to myself that record my journey to learn k8s using azure and github cicd

## Day 1: Setup Azure 
With copilot, azure is so much ez to use.

Probably shouldnt have started this first. cause the free credit is only valid for 30 days. . .

To setup everythings and make sure it work, i would create a react template and use this to test the function of k8s and github CI/CD pipeline. 

1. Develop Application
- anyway, i created this repo. I create a default template app using npx create-react-app.

```bash
npx create-react-app template
cd template
```
